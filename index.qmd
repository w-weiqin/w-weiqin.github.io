### Welcome to my world!

I am **Wei Qin**, a Year 2 **Fintech** student at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). 

Beyond the world of finance and technology, I am a passionate athlete. I play competitive basketball and enjoy staying active through regular gym sessions. I believe that the discipline required for sports translates directly into my academic and professional journey.
