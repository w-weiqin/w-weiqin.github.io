Most users provided unhelpful answers like “good” or “too pricy” just to receive their cash incentive.\nThe AI Intervention: We implemented a response evaluator that analyzed user inputs for logic, depth, and specific reasoning.\nThe Result: After implementation, the accuracy rate of meaningful feedback skyrocketed to 99%.\nRationale for the Visualization: I chose a Bar Chart to illustrate this because it clearly highlights the dramatic improvement in data quality. By ensuring that 99% of responses were high-quality, we guaranteed that our clients’ funds were being spent on actionable insights rather than “filler” responses."

    "text": "For this assessment, I utilized Gemini as a primary tool for both technical troubleshooting and content creation.\n\n\nOne of the most significant ways I used GenAI was for content generation. I provided Gemini with my summer internship report from Rally AI and asked it to: * Summarize Technical Contributions: It helped translate my raw report data into concise bullet points for my project page. * Draft Narratives: Gemini assisted in drafting a professional self-introduction for my homepage that balanced my Fintech studies with my passion for competitive basketball. * Refining Tone: The AI helped ensure my writing style was professional and suited for a public-facing portfolio.\n\n\n\nBeyond writing, Gemini acted as a technical partner for the website’s infrastructure: * YAML Debugging: It was instrumental in identifying the strict indentation requirements in the _quarto.yml file, which solved several rendering errors. * Layout Management: I used GenAI to learn the specific Quarto syntax needed to create a multi-column layout for my photos and text. * Prompt Engineering: My experience with prompt engineering during my internship helped me provide better context to Gemini, allowing it to generate the specific “Before vs After” data visualization narrative I needed for my hit-rate analysis.\n\n\n\nAs a Year 2 Fintech student transitioning from an accounting background, using GenAI has been a major boost to my productivity. It allowed me to focus on the high-level design and “story” of my website while it handled the complex formatting syntax. I see GenAI not just as a shortcut, but as a bridge that helps me apply my existing business knowledge to new technical challenges."
