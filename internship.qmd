## Overview

During the summer of 2025, I interned at **Rally AI**, an early-stage startup developing an AI-powered marketplace for mystery shoppers. My role involved bridging the gap between business operations and technical development.

## Technical ContributionsS

* **Prompt Engineering**: Developed response evaluators to check user inputs and built consumer profiling logic.
* **UI/UX Testing**: Designed mockups using Figma and conducted rigorous bug reporting in staging environments.
* **Feature Ideation**: Investigated “Receipt Fingerprint Hashing” as a method for fake receipt detection.

## Key Learnings

Transitioning from a finance background to a technical environment, I learned the importance of the “Growth Mindset” and proactive project management in a fast-paced startup.
